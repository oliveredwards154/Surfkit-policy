1.4 Shop Owner Contact Details
Optional contact information for surf shop listings you create, including phone number, email address, Facebook profile, Instagram handle, and physical shop address.
No other data is collected by the App. All information collected is provided directly by you, and any data displayed in the App (e.g., shop listings) comes from you or other users who choose to share that information.

2. How We Use Your Information

Enable shop owners to upload and display images of their shops.
Allow shop owners to share their contact details and address for customer inquiries.
Improve and personalize the App experience.
We do not use your information for advertising purposes, analytics beyond aggregated performance metrics, or sell your personal data to any third party.

3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not share your personal information with third parties, except:
Service providers who help us operate the App (e.g., cloud hosting, email notifications). They are bound by confidentiality agreements.
Legal requirements: to comply with applicable laws or respond to lawful requests from public authorities.

4. Data Retention
We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. You may delete your account at any time from the App settings, and we will remove your personal data within 30 days of your request, except where retention is required by law.

5. Security
We implement commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

6. Children’s Privacy
Our App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us to have the data deleted.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Last updated" date above.

8. Your Rights and Choices
Access and correction: You can view or update your account information in the App settings.
Deletion: You can delete your account and personal information at any time via the App settings or by contacting us.
